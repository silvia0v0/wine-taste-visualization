## Goals
The goal is to explore the wine taste dataset. 
Question: How is the score/points of the wine taste related to other features like price, country, and year?

## Rationale 
The histogram is chosen to summarize the average price of wine produced in each country, while the color also shows the score distribution of wine produced within that country.
The 3D scatter plot is chosen to show the wine taste score based on country, year, and price.
Furthermore, another 3D scatter plot is available based on user-selected country, to show the detailed information within that country. 

The wine taste score is represented using color as it is the most explicit and direct.

## Overview
Personal work.
Roughly 7-8 hours are spent, most time were spent figuring out how streamlit structures work and determine how to plot data to best answer the questions.
